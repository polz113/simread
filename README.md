# simread

This is a library for accessing SIM cards from python. Eventually, it should
be possible to at least replicate the functionality of 
[PySimReader](http://www.ladyada.net/make/simreader/download.html) 
using this library.

The first version of this library was written by Peter Kragelj as part of
a digital forensics class assignment at [FRI](http://www.fri.uni-lj.si).
